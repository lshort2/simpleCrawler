*Full discretion: Credit goes to Bucky Roberts for developing python tutorials on his* [website] (https://thenewboston.com/videos.php) *and introducing the idea of the web crawler/web spider.*

This project served as an opportunity to familiarize myself with Python and expand upon an existing project.

###TODO
- ~~Figure out how to make this guy obey robots.txt file~~ (done!)
- Update domain.py to allow more link formats (i.e. example.com instead of only https://www.example.com/)
