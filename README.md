# simpleCrawler - A Simple Web Crawler
Simple (multi-threaded) Web Crawler written in Python

Full discretion credit goes to Buck Roberts for tutorial posted online:

Chose to start from bottom up and go through the tutorial rather than just forking one in order to familiarize myself with python and the basic structure of how the crawler works, then build from there.

#TODO
- ~~Figure out how to make this guy obey robots.txt file~~ (done!)
- Update domain.py to allow more link formats (i.e. example.com instead of only https://www.examlpe.com/)
- Scrape facts from snapplefacts.com
